# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

`coord-sim` is not actively developed at the moment and no new features are expected for now.
The same goes for security updates.

`coord-sim` is meant for reasearch and best used in an isolated environment. 

We will certainly try to fix reported issues, but there are no guarantees or warranties.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Best to report security vulnerabilities in GitHub issues or directly fix them with a pull request.

If there is a severe security vulnerability that you want to disclose privately, you can contact stefan.schneider@upb.de
